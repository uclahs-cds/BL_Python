# Boutros Lab Python Libraries [ `BL_Python` ]

A collection of Python libraries for creating web applications, working with databases, writing tests, and supporting utilities.

# Quick Starts

**ðŸš©** `BL_Python` has a minimum Python version requirement of `>= 3.10`.

*  Create a BL_Python [web application](src/web/README.md)


# Available Libraries

Following are each of the libraries in this repository.

They can be used in Python under the `BL_Python` namespace. For example, to use the database libraries you would import from `BL_Python.database`.

To use these packages during development of `BL_Python` itself, please refer to [Development](#development).

# Development

`BL_Python` is a mono-repo containing several independent libraries, which are noted under [Available Libraries](#available-libraries).

When developing from within the mono-repo, the libraries can be individually installed by referencing their path. Both the mono-repo and each library have their own set of dependencies.

To install the base dependencies, run `pip install -e .` from the mono-repo root. Development dependencies can be installed with `pip install -e .[dev-dependencies]`

To install the library dependencies, run, for example, `pip install -e src/web` to install `BL_Python.web`. Similar to the mono-repo, development dependencies can be installed with `pip install -e src/web[dev-dependencies]`.

## Important requirement!

Due to limitations in `pip`, some `BL_Python` libraries that depend on other `BL_Python` libraries need those dependencies explicitly defined in applications using those libraries.

The libraries that require this will outline their explicit dependencies in their respective readme files. `pip` will also show an error if these requirements are not met, which will aid in discovery of invalid dependency configurations in your software.
