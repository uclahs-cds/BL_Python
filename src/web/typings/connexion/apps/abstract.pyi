        Connects a URL rule.  Works exactly like the `route` decorator.  If a view_func is provided it will be
        registered with the endpoint.

        Basically this example::

            @app.route('/')
            def index():
                pass

        Is equivalent to the following::

            def index():
                pass
            app.add_url_rule('/', 'index', index)

        If the view_func is not provided you will need to connect the endpoint to a view function like so::

            app.view_functions['index'] = index

        Internally`route` invokes `add_url_rule` so if you want to customize the behavior via subclassing you only need
        to change this method.

        :param endpoint: the endpoint for the registered URL rule. Flask itself assumes the name of the view function as

                        to Werkzeug is handling of method options. methods is a list of methods this rule should be
                        limited to (`GET`, `POST` etc.).  By default a rule just listens for `GET` (and implicitly
                        `HEAD`).
